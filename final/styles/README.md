All other media were done start to finish by me.

I borrow some small sections from previous assignments to assist me in getting my foundation quicker. I had some issues messing around with margin to get my webpage to not be ugly.

I elected to remove the hamburger menu as truthfully it was a little outside of my skillset. I attempted it at least which I am happy with. I think the final product came out pretty well for using 3 media queries but at one point I was tempted to use 4 just for the hell of it.

Other than that, thing went pretty smoothly beyond having some issues with my margin and grid conflicting. But that's to be expected.
